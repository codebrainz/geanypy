GeanyPy
=======

Write Geany plugins in Python!

*Please note:* since GeanyPy is under heavy development, the API it exposes
may change quite drastically.  If you start using GeanyPy to write plugins,
drop me a line and I'll do my best to not break your code.

*Update:* There's now some documentation available, visit
http://codebrainz.github.com/geanypy to read it.

How it works
------------

In the `src/` directory is a normal Geany plugin (`plugin.c`) which loads the
Python interpreter.  It then loads some C Python modules (`dialogs.c`,
`documents.c`, etc.) that interface with Geany's C API.  After that, it loads
the `geany` Python module which is just glue/sugar-coating to make the C
module more "Pythonic".

To write a plugin, inherit from the `geany.Plugin` class and implmenent the
required members (see `geany/plugin.py` documentation comments).  Then put the
plugin in a searched plugin path.  Currently two locations are search for
plugins.  The first is `PREFIX/lib/geany` and the recommended
location is under your personal Geany directory (usually
`~/.config/geany/plugins`). To load or unload plugins, use Geany's regular Plugin
Manager. Python plugins appear there once GeanyPy is activated.

When the Python Console plugin is enabled, it will add a new tab to the notebook in
the message window area that contains an interactive Python shell with the `geany`
module pre-imported.  You can tinker around with API with this console, for
example:


```python
import geany # called automatically in the built-in interactive shell

doc = geany.document.open("/some/file/here")

print(doc.file_name)
print(doc.file_type.display_name)

geany.dialogs.show_msgbox("Hello World")

geany.main_widgets.window.set_title("Hello Window")

def on_document_open(doc):
    print("Document '%s' was opened" % doc.file_name)

geany.signals.connect('document-open', on_document_open)

```

Dependencies
------------

To build GeanyPy you need the following dependencies:

* Python 2.6+ and development files (I don't think Python 3 will work).
* Geany 0.21+ and development files (from SVN)
* PyGTK 2.0 and development files

On Debian/Ubuntu, the (non-Geany) dependencies can be installed like this:

    $ apt-get install python python-dev python-gtk2 python-gtk2-dev

See Geany's documentation/website for information on compiling it from the
Subversion or Git repositories.

Installation
------------

First you need to know where Geany is installed:

    $ GEANY_PREFIX=`pkg-config --variable=prefix geany`

The you can install as normal:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=$GEANY_PREFIX
    $ make
    # make install

You should be able to force a specific version of Python to be used, by using
the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable, but I've only tested with 2.6.6 so
far.  I imagine 2.7 series will also work fine.

Running on Windows
